# 👋 Introduction
With MobFreeze, you have the power to freeze mobs in their tracks, turning them immobile and unaffected by gravity. This plugin opens up creative possibilities, allowing you to decorate your Minecraft world, such as horses hitched to carriages in a western village.

# ❓ How to Use
To use MobFreeze, simply right-click on any mob while holding any type of ice block (blue ice, packed ice, or regular ice), which will be consumed in the process. This feature enables you to create static and visually stunning arrangements. Want to thaw out a frozen mob? No problem! Just right-click with a flint and steel in hand to bring them back to life.
